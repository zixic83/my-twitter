# myTwitter
This is a Twitter clone I built for my own use. 

## Getting Started
### Dependencies
- React JS
- Node JS
- Mongo DB (Mongoose)

### Setup
- Back-end server: <a href='https://github.com/zixic83/my-twitter-back-end'>Github repository</a>
- A user has to be set up manually from the back end when used for the first time
