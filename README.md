# myTwitter
This is a private local Twitter clone I built for my own use. I use it as my personal digital journal. 

## Getting Started
### Dependencies
- React JS
- Node JS
- Mongo DB (Mongoose)

### Setup
- Back-end server: <a href='https://github.com/zixic83/my-twitter-back-end'>Github repository</a>
- A user has to be set up manually from the back end when used for the first time
- Note: This site essentially does not support local file upload, since it is a security risk from the browser's perspective to allow the front-end to have direct access to local file system paths (e.g. C:\Documents\sample.jpg), so I acutally set up another local file server to get around the issue when I personally use it (e.g. localhost:5000/files/sample.jpg).
